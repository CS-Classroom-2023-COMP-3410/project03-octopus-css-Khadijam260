I have a background in CSS so I mainly used the developer tools and inspect element to help with this project.

I find CSS much easier when it is in an external file, it feels more organized that way. I looked at the HTML and looked at all the block and inline elements and I added an id to most of the blocks, it is easier to style things that way and you can keep styling more seperate.

I utilized w3schools.com alot, they have a ton of tutorials, and it felt more productive for me to use that instead of chatgpt. If I forgot or didn't know how to add a certain style I'd quickly do a google search and it would pop right up. It also has a demo so I'd know exactly what it should look like before I attempt adding it to my file.

I ran into issues with the form part, especially when I tried to reformat the image and the text, and the form itsself. When I first tried it, the spacing was completely off, then I attempted to use chatgpt and it kept giving me the wrong input, I got very frustrated and just started that section again from scratch. I went over the different positions in CSS and played around with it and I eventually got it to work. 

Although I had somewhat of a background in CSS, I still did a lot of trial and error and seeing what styles worked together and which ones didn't and then tweaking my code as such.
